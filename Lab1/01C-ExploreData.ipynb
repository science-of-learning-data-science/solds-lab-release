    "## Part 0 - Reminder about collaboration on lab assignments in PSYC 193L\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly believe in the value of collaborating with your peers for enhancing your learning experience in PSYC 193L. Being able to successfully collaborate with others is an important skill to have when you enter the workforce, and everyone can get better at collaboration with practice. However, for collaboration to be maximally valuable, we need to set some ground rules, building on the expectations laid out in the [course syllabus](https://science-of-learning-data-science.github.io/): Show Up, Try, Ask for Help When You Need It, Be Professional. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines\n",
    "* Rotate responsibilities between group members. \n",
    "* Choose a driver and a navigator.\n",
    "* Discuss your thinking process openly with your group. \n",
    "* Be supportive, respectful, and patient with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rotate responsibilities between group members. \n",
    "You will generally be working with the same people (from your discussion section) for each lab, and a new group of people for the next lab. Because you will be working with the same classmates for the next week or so, you will have the opportunity to share responsibilities with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choose a driver and a navigator.\n",
    "We suggest that one group member volunteer to act as the \"driver\" (and share their screen) while the other group members act as the \"navigators.\" Next time, it is a good idea to exchange roles, so that everyone gets a chance to act as the driver at least once, if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discuss your thinking process openly with your group. \n",
    "We suggest that you discuss the way you are thinking about each problem with your group. It is more important to us that you gain practice explaining your reasoning to yourself and to your peers than it is to simply state what you think the \"right answer\" is, without explaining your reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Be supportive, respectful, and patient with one another. \n",
    "Try to give everyone an opportunity to play both a leading and supporting role. If you feel relatively comfortable with R, we encourage you to proactively encourage other members of your group who feel the least confident about writing R code to take a leading role. If you feel less confident about your R skills, please know that you are not alone! With practice and persistence over the course of the coming weeks, you will find your skills improving! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Every student is still responsible for submitting their own lab assignments. \n",
    "Although you are encouraged to work together on these lab assignments, please remember that everyone is responsiblef or submitting their own assignments on Canvas. "
